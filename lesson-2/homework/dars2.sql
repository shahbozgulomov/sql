--Define and explain DDL and DML. Give two examples of each.
--DDL(data definition language) create,alter 
--DML(data manipulation language) delete,insert

--Explain the difference between VARCHAR and NVARCHAR when creating tables.
--Use VARCHAR when you are dealing with single-byte character data and want to save storage space.

--Modify an existing column Salary to change its data type to FLOAT.
ALTER TABLE Employees
ALTER COLUMN Salary FLOAT;

ALTER TABLE Employees
DROP COLUMN
